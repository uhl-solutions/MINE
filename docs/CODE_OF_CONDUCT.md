## Reporting

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior, please report it as soon as possible.

**Preferred reporting method**
- Email: **conduct@uhl.solutions**

If you do not have a dedicated address yet, you can:
- Use the project security contact if one exists, or
- Ask a maintainer to set up a private reporting email/alias

When reporting, please include (if you can):

- Your contact information (so we can follow up)
- Names (or usernames) of involved individuals
- The date/time and location of the incident
- A description of what happened
- Any relevant context, screenshots, links, or logs

We will respect your privacy and handle reports as confidentially as possible, sharing details only with people who need to know to investigate and respond.

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and to temporarily or permanently ban any contributor for behaviors they consider inappropriate.

## Enforcement Guidelines

Maintainers will follow these Community Impact Guidelines to determine the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

### 1) Correction
**Community impact:** Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome.  
**Consequence:** A private, written warning providing clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

### 2) Warning
**Community impact:** A violation through a single incident or a series of actions.  
**Consequence:** A private, written warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the people involved may be required for a specified period. Continued violations may lead to a temporary or permanent ban.

### 3) Temporary Ban
**Community impact:** A serious violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior.  
**Consequence:** A temporary ban from any interaction with the project for a specified time. Violating the terms of the ban may lead to a permanent ban.

### 4) Permanent Ban
**Community impact:** Demonstrated pattern of violation of community standards, harassment, or aggressive behavior, or a single egregious incident.  
**Consequence:** A permanent ban from any interaction with the project.

## Appeals

If you believe an enforcement action was made in error, you may appeal by emailing:

- **conduct@uhl.solutions** with the subject line **"CoC Appeal"**

Appeals will be reviewed by maintainers not directly involved in the original decision when possible.
